This is the official implementation for the paper "*Rethink Sparse Signals for Pose-guided Text-to-image Generation*", accepted by ICCV 2025. We propose a Spatial-Pose ControlNet, namely *SP-Ctrl*, which equips sparse signals with robust controllability for pose-guided image generation. Our work features an improved spatial-pose representation and a keypoint-concept learning and alignment strategy. Please refer to our paper for more details.
